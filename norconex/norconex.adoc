Crawl & Graph
Norconex et Neo4j

Introduction
============

A major problem when we need to enter data in a graph is the data injection. For test purpose or other goals, the issue is still the same, how to inject data quickly, with a minima ETL effort. There're many ways to import data into Neo4j, with import tool or Cypher LOAD CSV instruction for example.

But we can also imagine an other way to do that. Especially if we want to grab some data coming from the web.

A great tool can help us to do that, and here I want to talk about Norconex crawlers.

Why Norconex?
Because thereâ€™re many collectors provided by Norconex (Http, FileSystem,Sql, etc.) and many connectors where inject the data (SQL, Elastic Search, Solr, etc.). And because the solution is simple to understand (not only technical) and business oriented, really.

Into a simple configuration, you can connect an input (a data collector) to an output (a committer) and doing some transformations between them.
It acts like an ETL.
Here, I want to expose the Neo4j Committer for Norconex.

Crawling the web
====================

Crawling the web is basically simple. The mechanism consists on downloading a starting page, extract its content, and extract the links.
Each link is pushed into a queue generally known under the name of "frontier". Then, the crawler take the next link from the frontier, download the page, extract its content, extract the links and so on...

When we would to crawl the web, we have to consider some rules:
- The politness 
- The pages with interesting links
- The pages with interestig content (or both) 

The politness
=============
It is very important to understand that. We don't want "attack" a web site, we want just grabbing useful data.
And we have to be "polite" with the site, to do that:
- respect of ROBOTS.TXT
- respect of no-follow rules
- provide a think time (a pause time between two consecutive downloads) to let the web site "breath"

You can omit these rules, but if you do that, you expose yourself to be blacklisted from this web site or domain.


Pages with interesting links
============================

Sometimes, we only want the links from a web page, because the text content is not really interesting.
A Home page is usually a good example. For a clear graph, we should exclude these kind of pages.

Pages with interesting content
==============================

In counterpart, some pages have the wanted content. Then we can import this page (document) to treated by Norconex to finally push it into Neo4j.

Link the data
=============

This is probably the most difficult thing to do. Because we need to imagine a strategy to link these pages:
- url and referrer url linking strategy: and you obtain a graph of crawl, useful to see how the crawler browse the web
- metadata based linking strategy :
