# Moving relationships

## introduction

A graph database is not a simple way to store connected data, it's also a powerful tool for managing dynamic relationships between data. 
And because relationships are natively implemented in Neo4j, we can use them as a simply way to identify a group of connected nodes. But it's not the only usage we can do of them.
It seems many use cases where Relationships move between nodes in subsequent queries. Theses relationships are specialized to mark a state of a sub graph.
